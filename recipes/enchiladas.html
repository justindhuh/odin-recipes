    <p>This authentic chicken enchilada recipe is made with fresh green salsa, just like you would find in a Mexican restaurant or better yet, in a Mexican home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion, halved, divided</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
        <li>5 serrano peppers, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled queso fresco</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, broth, one quarter onion, salt, and 1 clove garlic in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a large bowl to cool. Reserve broth; discard onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, shred chicken with your hands.</li>
        <li>Place tomatillos and serrano peppers in a medium pot and cover with water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and cook until tomatillos turn from bright green to dull, army green.</li>
        <li>Strain tomatillos and peppers and place in a blender. Add remaining one quarter onion, remaining 1 clove garlic, and a pinch of salt. Pour in enough reserved broth to cover vegetables in the blender by about 1 inch.</li>
        <li>Blend until completely pur√©ed.</li>
        <li>Pour salsa into a medium saucepan and bring to a low boil.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Lightly fry tortillas, one at time, in hot oil. Remove to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Dip tortillas in low-boiling salsa until they become soft again. Place onto plates, 3 per person.</li>
        <li>Fill or cover tortillas with shredded chicken, then top with salsa.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with queso fresco, onion, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
